- Milestones and deliverables per iteration

**Template:**
| Iteration | Goals | Deliverables | Duration |
|-----------|-------|--------------|----------|
| Iteration 1 | System vision, prototype | Vision doc, working prototype | 1 week |
| Iteration 2 | Feature A | Code, tests, documentation | 1 week |
| Iteration 3 | Feature B + integrations | Demo-ready product | 2 weeks |

---

### **5. Requirements and Analysis**

**Purpose:** Understand user needs and functional requirements.

**Include:**
- User Stories / Use Cases
- Business Rules
- Functional Requirements
- Non-functional Requirements (performance, usability)

**Example Use Case:**
**Title:** Capture Supplier Info  
**Actor:** Purchasing Agent  
**Description:** The agent records supplier contact and product data at a trade show.

---

### **6. Design Documentation**

**Purpose:** Translate requirements into technical solutions.

**Include:**
- Architecture Diagram
- UI Wireframes / Prototypes
- Data Models / ER Diagrams
- Technology stack overview

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Interfaces defined
- [ ] Data model validated

- Reference to automated code documentation

---

### **8. Testing & QA**

**Purpose:** Ensure the system meets all defined criteria.

**Include:**
- Test plan with test cases per feature
- Manual/automated test procedures
- Bug tracking and fix log
- User Acceptance Test (UAT) feedback

**Template:**
| Test Case | Input | Expected Result | Status |
|-----------|-------|-----------------|--------|
| TC-01 | Add supplier | Supplier saved | ‚úÖ |
| TC-02 | No name entered | Error message | ‚úÖ |

---

### **9. Deployment & Launch Plan**

**Purpose:** Prepare and execute a smooth rollout.

**Include:**
- Deployment steps
- System environment setup
- Rollback plan
- Training & support documentation

**Checklist:**
- [ ] Production access granted
- [ ] Deployment tested in staging
- [ ] Backup plan confirmed
- [ ] End-user training provided

---

### **10. Post-Launch Evaluation**

**Purpose:** Verify the system solves the original problem and plan next steps.

**Include:**
- Metrics of success (time saved, transactions processed, etc.)
- Feedback collection summary
- Future improvements / backlog
- Lessons learned

---

## üîÅ How to Use This Framework

- **Reusable:** Apply the same structure to future projects by filling in the blanks.
- **Modular:** Skip sections not relevant for small features or prototypes.
- **Traceable:** Keep all documentation in a centralized system (e.g., Confluence, Notion, SharePoint).
