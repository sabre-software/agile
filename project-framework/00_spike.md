## üîç **Spike Framework**

### **1. Purpose of the Spike**
- **Goal:** Conduct research or investigation to reduce uncertainty and gather the necessary details for making informed decisions about the project.
- **Deliverable:** *Spike Report* (a summary document that outlines findings and decisions made during the spike phase)

### **2. Key Areas to Explore**

#### **a. Project Scope & Objectives**
**Questions:**
- What problem does the project aim to solve?
- What are the main objectives for the project (e.g., technical improvements, business outcomes)?
- What are the initial boundaries of the project (scope), and what is out of scope?

#### **b. Key Requirements**
**Questions:**
- What are the high-level functional requirements of the system (e.g., user stories or key features)?
- What are the non-functional requirements (e.g., performance, security)?
- Are there any constraints or business rules that must be considered?

#### **c. Technology Stack & Tools**
**Questions:**
- What technologies or platforms need to be used (e.g., programming languages, frameworks, third-party tools)?
- Are there any integration needs with existing systems or databases?
- What technologies should be avoided based on potential risks or limitations?

#### **d. Timeline & Milestones**
**Questions:**
- What is the expected duration of the project, and what are key deadlines or milestones?
- What are the short-term and long-term goals for the project?
- Are there dependencies or external factors that may impact the timeline?

#### **e. Risks & Constraints**
**Questions:**
- What are the key risks or uncertainties related to the project (e.g., technical challenges, resource limitations)?
- Are there any regulatory or compliance constraints that must be addressed?
- What mitigation strategies should be considered for identified risks?

### **3. Spike Report Structure**

The final **Spike Report** should summarize the findings in a concise, clear format. The structure of the report will include:

1. **Project Overview:**
   - Brief description of the problem, objectives, and scope.
   
2. **Key Requirements:**
   - High-level functional and non-functional requirements.
   
3. **Technology Stack & Tools:**
   - Recommended technologies, frameworks, and tools for the project.
   - Any constraints on technology choices.
   
4. **Timeline & Milestones:**
   - Estimated project duration, key milestones, and deadlines.
   
5. **Risks & Constraints:**
   - Identified risks, challenges, and constraints, along with possible mitigation strategies.

### **4. Outcome of the Spike**

The **Spike Report** will help in making informed decisions about:
- The feasibility of proceeding with the project.
- The choice of technologies and tools to use.
- The establishment of a clear timeline and project scope.

**Future Steps:**
- The **Spike Report** will serve as the foundation for creating detailed documentation, including:
  - Project plan (with iterations and deliverables).
  - Technical documentation (e.g., architecture, design).
  - Testing and quality assurance plans.
  - Deployment and launch plans.

## üõ† **Summary**

This simplified **Spike Framework** focuses on the initial research phase needed to explore uncertainties and gather the core information required to launch the project. The outcome is a **Spike Report**, which provides an essential overview of the project and serves as the foundation for more detailed documentation later on.
